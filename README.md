# go-complete-dev-guide

- This [go-complete-dev-guide](https://github.com/tobyartisan/go-complete-dev-guide) repository is the code that is created while doing the Udemy course at [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/).
- The author's GitHub branch is at [StephenGrider / GoCasts](https://github.com/StephenGrider/GoCasts).
- My fork of that brach is at [tobyartisan-forks / GoCasts](https://github.com/tobyartisan-forks/GoCasts). My fork is used as a reference point in case the author's branch needs to be referenced as-is in the future.
